# GreenBook

**GreenBook** is a sophisticated Flask-based golf simulation platform that creates an entire professional golf tour ecosystem ‚Äì complete with realistic tournament simulation, dynamic player progression, and comprehensive betting systems using **play money only**. Think of it as a combination of PGA Tour simulation, fantasy sports, and sports betting analytics, all wrapped in an elegant Augusta National-inspired interface.

## üéØ Project Vision

GreenBook aims to be the most realistic and comprehensive golf simulation platform available, featuring:

- **35-Event Professional Season**: Complete tour schedule with majors, signature events, and standard tournaments
