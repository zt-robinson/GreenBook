# Golf Universe: Flask Golf Simulation & Betting Platform

## Project Vision & Goals

Golf Universe is a highly detailed, Flask-based golf simulation and sports betting web application. The goal is to create a living, evolving golf world that mirrors the drama, structure, and excitement of the PGA Tourâ€”complete with:
- Realistic player careers, tour card mechanics, and dynamic field qualification
- A full season schedule of tournaments, including majors, invitationals, and opens
- Real-time, granular simulation of tournament play (hole-by-hole, group-by-group)
- A comprehensive betting platform with a wide variety of markets and live odds
- Persistent player histories, career arcs, and a developmental tour system
- A beautiful, modern, and user-friendly web interface

## Current Features (as of June 2025)

### Data & Simulation
- **Player Database:** 200+ generated players, each with realistic skill ratings, country, age, and career stats
- **Tour Card System:** Each player has a `TourCardStatus` (Full, Exempt, Conditional, None, Lifetime) and an `Exempt_Thru` year, determining eligibility for events
- **Course Database:** 30+ championship courses, each with detailed characteristics (yardage, par, weather, green speed, elevation, etc.)
- **Tournament Database:** Robust structure for tournaments, fields, results, odds, schedule, and payout structure
- **Developmental Tour:** Players who lose their card move to a separate dev league, with a chance to re-qualify each year

### Web Application
- **Home Page:** Modern, welcoming landing page with quick stats and navigation
- **Players Page:** Table of all players, expandable for detailed stats and career info
- **Courses Page:** Table of all courses, expandable for professional scorecards and real-world characteristics
- **Schedule Page:** Table of all upcoming tournaments, with field size, purse, start date, and round times (in EST)
- **Navigation:** Clean, modern navigation bar for all major sections

### Tournament & Schedule System
- **Tournament Types:** Regular Tour Events, Opens, Invitationals, Majors, and a future Tour Championship
- **Field Sizes:** Vary by event type (e.g., 156 for regular, 90 for invitationals, 90-120 for majors)
- **Qualification:** Full/Exempt/Lifetime status, then Conditional, then recent top performers, then former major winners, then players ranked 151-200
- **Event Timing:** Each event is scheduled two days apart, with the first event set for July 4, 2025
- **Round Structure:** 4 rounds per event, with staggered group starts and cut after round 2
- **Payouts & Points:** Each event has a detailed payout and points structure

## Technical Structure

- **Flask** for backend and routing
- **SQLite** for persistent storage (players, courses, tournaments, dev league)
- **Jinja2** for templating and dynamic HTML
- **Modern CSS** for a clean, responsive UI
- **Seeding Scripts** for generating and resetting all data

## Simulation & Game Mechanics

### Tour Card & Career System
- Players start with a tour card; status is re-evaluated each season
- Top 125: Full card; 126-150: Conditional; 151-200: Lose card, move to dev league
- Exemptions for wins, majors, and career achievements (tracked by `Exempt_Thru`)
- Dev league simulates a season, top 30 rejoin the main tour, new players generated each year
- Lifetime status for 20+ wins and 15+ seasons

### Tournament Simulation
- 4 rounds, 72-hole stroke play
- Rounds 1-2: 3-man groups, random order; Rounds 3-4: 2-man groups, sorted by score
- Cut after round 2 (top 65 and ties)
- Each group plays a hole every 3 minutes, with rounds and breaks scheduled for real-time betting
- Tournament schedule is persistent and visible on the web

### Betting System (Planned)
- Outright winner, top 5/10/20, make the cut, low round, group winner, round leader, 9-hole leader, bogey-free round, H2H matchups, over/under, birdie props, and more
- Odds update after every hole, and multiple times between rounds
- Odds calculation factors: player skill, current score, course/weather, pressure, momentum, history
- Pre-tournament odds update weekly; live odds update in real time during events
- Full betting UI for placing, tracking, and settling bets

## Roadmap & Planned Features

### Short-Term
- Tournament field generation logic (based on qualification rules above)
- Tournament simulation engine (group-by-group, hole-by-hole)
- Live odds calculation and updating
- Betting UI and bet settlement logic
- Player career stats and history page
- Dev league auto-simulation and player promotion

### Long-Term
- Tour Championship with special rules and points system
- Player injury, fatigue, and form tracking
- Sponsorships and pressure mechanics
- User accounts and persistent bet tracking
- Admin UI for adding/editing tournaments, courses, and players
- API for external integrations (e.g., Discord bots, mobile apps)
- More advanced betting markets and analytics

## How Everything Fits Together

- **Players** are the core of the sim, with evolving careers, stats, and eligibility
- **Courses** provide unique challenges and realism for each event
- **Tournaments** are scheduled, simulated, and bet on in real time
- **Betting** is the main user interaction, with a wide variety of markets and live odds
- **Dev League** ensures turnover and new talent, keeping the world dynamic
- **UI** is designed for clarity, beauty, and ease of use, with all data calculated in the backend for fast rendering

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Generate the player and course databases
5. Run the tournament and schedule seeding scripts
6. Start the Flask app: `python app.py`
