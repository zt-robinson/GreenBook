### Prehistory System
For the first 20 seasons, a "prehistory" system creates initial player rankings:
1. Generate 600 players (ages 19-22)
2. Run 10 "Gauntlet Season" tournaments (600-player fields, 72 holes each)
3. Cull to top 100 players + add 50 new players
4. Run 10 seasons of 35 events each to establish historical rankings
5. After each season: cull bottom 50, age remaining players, add 50 new players

### Physical Skills (0-100 scale)
- `driving_power`: Distance off the tee
- `driving_accuracy`: Fairway finding ability
- `approach_accuracy`: Iron play and approach shots
- `short_game`: Chipping, pitching, bunker play
- `putting`: Green reading and putting skill

### Mental Attributes (0-100 scale)

## üé´ Tour Card Status & Priority System

### Tour Card Status Types

#### Fully Exempt
- Top 100 from final prior season points list
- Top 20 players from Development Tour
- Top 5 players from Q School Tournament
- Winners of events (automatic exemptions based on event category)

#### Conditionally Exempt
- Players 101-125 on final prior season points list
- Do not have guaranteed entry into most events
- Eligible to fill remaining spots after priority categories
- Can earn points and money, potentially regain full status

#### Non-Exempt
- Have no standing on priority list
- Can only play via tournament-specific exemptions or Monday qualifying
- Do not accrue points
- Can earn money but doesn't count toward standings unless status regained

### Priority Lists (8 event types)
Priority lists are dynamically calculated after every event and determine field invitations:

1. **Standard Events**: 17 priority categories
2. **Standard Invitationals**: 7 priority categories  
3. **Signature Events**: 12 priority categories
4. **Continental Championship**: 12 priority categories
5. **Sovereign Tournament**: 12 priority categories
6. **AGA Championship**: 12 priority categories
7. **American Open**: 10 priority categories
8. **Royal Open**: 10 priority categories

### Priority List Update System
- **Frequency**: After every single event completion
- **Scope**: All 8 priority lists are recalculated after each event
- **Logic**: Dynamic calculation based on latest results and updated criteria
- **Field Updates**: Active fields for all subsequent events are updated

### Update Flow Example
```
Week 1: Sovereign Tournament (Major #1) completes
‚Üí Update all 8 priority lists
‚Üí Royal Open field now includes Sovereign winner
‚Üí AGA Championship field updated
‚Üí American Open field updated
‚Üí All other event fields updated based on new results

Week 2: Standard Event #1 completes  
‚Üí Update all 8 priority lists again
‚Üí Any new winners/qualifiers added to future events
‚Üí Points standings updated
‚Üí Rankings recalculated
```

### Implementation Logic
```python
# After each event completes:
for event_type in all_8_event_types:
    priority_list = calculate_priority_list(event_type, current_season_results)
    update_future_event_fields(event_type, priority_list)
```

### Key Points
- **Exemption Status**: Handled separately (end-of-season processing)
- **Points/Rankings**: Updated after each event
- **Dynamic Qualification**: Winners immediately qualify for future events
- **Cascading Updates**: Each event result affects multiple future events

### Monday Qualifying System
- **Format**: Single-round, 18-hole simulation
- **Participants**: Eligible non-exempt or conditional players
- **Qualification**: Top 4 finishers earn guaranteed spot in upcoming event
- **Timing**: Held on off-days between events

### Automatic Exemptions Based on Victories
- **Standard/Invitational**: +2 seasons
- **Signature Event**: +3 seasons
- **Tour Championship**: +3 seasons
- **Continental Championship**: +4 seasons
- **Major Championship**: +5 seasons
- **Extension Cap**: Maximum +7 seasons per season
- **Forward Limit**: Cannot extend beyond 7 seasons from current season

## üé≤ Simulation Engine

### Hole-by-Hole Simulation Flow

1. **Retrieve Static Data**
   - Course attributes (par, yardage, difficulty, terrain, etc.)
   - Player attributes (skills and mental stats)

2. **Apply Dynamic Modifiers**
   - Weather factors (wind, rain, temperature, humidity, cloudiness)
   - Tournament context (prestige factor, pressure)

3. **Calculate Final Values**
   - Hole difficulty (X) = base difficulty √ó environmental modifiers
   - Player performance (Y) = base skills √ó environmental modifiers

4. **Determine Outcome**
   - Performance delta = Y - X
   - Use delta to determine probabilistic score outcome

### Skill Weighting by Hole Type

#### Par 3 Holes
- Driving Power: 10%
- Driving Accuracy: 20%
- Approach Accuracy: 60%
- Short Game: 5%
- Putting: 5%

#### Par 4 Holes
- Driving Power: 30%
- Driving Accuracy: 30%
- Approach Accuracy: 30%
- Short Game: 5%
- Putting: 5%

#### Par 5 Holes
- Driving Power: 40%
- Driving Accuracy: 25%
- Approach Accuracy: 25%
- Short Game: 5%
- Putting: 5%

### Real-World Entropy System
Randomness seeded by:
- Current timestamp hash
- Live weather values from real locations
- Last 4 digits of Bitcoin or stock index
- Mixed and hashed into entropy float
- Resets per round or per hole

### Mental Game Mechanics
- **Confidence Fluctuation**: Based on recent form and hole performance
- **Pressure Situations**: Final holes, final rounds, big tournaments
- **Risk Tolerance**: Affects scoring variance and strategy decisions
- **Mental Fatigue**: Increases over tournament duration
- **Skill Modification**: Mental attributes modify physical skill effectiveness

## üí∞ Payout & Points System

### FedExCup Points Distribution

| Position | Standard Event | Standard Invitational | Signature Event | Major/Continental |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 750 |
| 2 | 300 | 300 | 400 | 500 |
| 3 | 190 | 270 | 350 | 300 |
| 4 | 135 | 230 | 325 | 325 |
| 5 | 110 | 205 | 300 | 300 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Payout Systems

#### Two Payout Systems:

1. **Unified CSV System** (Standard Events, Continental Championship, Majors):
   - Uses `greenbook/data/53_85_payout_structure.csv`
   - Covers scenarios from 53 to 85 paid players
   - Handles variable cut lines and field sizes
   - Each scenario sums to exactly 100%

2. **Static Table System** (Standard Invitationals & Signature Events):
   - Fixed 72-player field with no cut line
   - Uses Signature Events payout table
   - All 72 players guaranteed to be paid
   - Single payout scenario summing to exactly 100%

#### Implementation Logic
```python
# For Signature Events & Standard Invitationals:
if event_type in ['signature_event', 'standard_invitational']:
    use_static_72_player_table()
    
# For all other events (Standard Events, Continental, Majors):
else:
    players_making_cut = determine_cut_size(event_results)
    payout_percentages = lookup_csv_payouts(players_making_cut)
```

#### Example
- **Signature Event**: Always 72 players, use static table
- **Standard Event**: Cut line "Top 65 and ties" ‚Üí if 67 players make cut, use 67-player scenario from CSV
- **Major**: Cut line varies by major ‚Üí if 70 players make cut, use 70-player scenario from CSV

### Tie Handling
- Tied players receive average payout of their tied positions
- Example: Two players tied for 1st each get 16.5% (average of 1st and 2nd)
