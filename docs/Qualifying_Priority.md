- On the following off-day, a Monday Qualifying Tournament is held:
  - Format: Single-round, 18-hole simulation
  - Participants: Eligible non-exempt or conditional players not already in the field
- The top four finishers earn a guaranteed spot in the upcoming event’s field (Priority Slot x) - These players must accept their spot and cannot decline entry
- Once the Monday Qualifiers are finalized, the rest of the event field is completed using the remaining portions of the priority list (Priority xi–xvii)
- Monday Qualifiers do not confer status or points by themselves; however, players may accrue earnings and results if they perform well in the event

## Effect of Winning Events

### Automatic Exemptions Based on Victories

- A player’s Tour exempt status may be automatically extended based on victories earned during a season. The number of seasons added depends on the category of event won:
    - Standard / Invitational: +2 seasons
    - Signature Event:	+3 seasons
    - Tour Championship: +3 seasons
    - Continental Championship: +4 seasons
    - Major Championship: +5 seasons
- Extension Cap Per Season
  - A player cannot extend their exempt status by more than +7 seasons in total from victories won during a single season.
  - If multiple wins would push a player’s exemption beyond 7 additional seasons, the effect is capped at +7.
  - For example: If Player A wins a major (+5), a signature event (+3), and a standard event (+2) in Year 1, their exempt status is extended by +7 seasons total, not +10.

### Maximum Forward-Looking Limit

- In any given season, a player's exempt status may not extend further than seven seasons beyond the current season.
- If a player already holds exempt status into future years and wins an event, the additional exemption years are applied only up to this 7-year maximum.
- This ensures that no player may hold automatic exempt status further than Year N + 7, where N is the current season.
- Example:
  - Player B is in Season 2 and is already exempt through Season 7 (5 years out).
  - Player B wins a major, which normally grants +5 years of exemption.
  - Because only 2 more years can be added before reaching the 7-year limit, Player B's exemption is extended only through Season 9, not Season 12.
- Any further wins in Season 2 will not extend their exemption further.

### Summary Rules

- Exemption extensions are automatic based on event category.
- Extensions are capped at 7 years per season.
- Exempt status cannot reach beyond the 7th season after the current year.
- Additional wins beyond the cap in a given season have no further impact on exemption.

## END-OF-YEAR TOUR CARD PROCESSING

- Reset every player's exempt_status based on:
  - Final points list ranking
  - Dev/Q School graduates
  - Event win exemptions carried forward (see Section 3)
- Recalculate every player's Exempt Through Season (ETS) marker.
  - From:
  - Previous ETS if not expired
  - Plus event wins (capped per Section 3)
- Assign statuses:
  - Fully Exempt = if ETS ≥ current_year + 1
  - Conditionally Exempt = if ranked 101–125 and no current ETS
  - Non-Exempt = if no ETS and ranked 126+
- Generate next year's priority list using:
  - Victory-based exemption categories first
  - Then points-based rankings (FedEx/Championship)
  - Then conditional players
  - Then alternates/non-exempts
