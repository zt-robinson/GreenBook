At all times, there should be priority lists for each of the eight event types:
- Standard events
- Standard invitationals
- Signature events
- The Continential Championship
- The Sovereign Tournament
- The AGA Championship
- The American Open
- The Royal Open

These priority lists are updated at the end of every single event. They determine who gets priority for being invited to the next event of that type.

When an event of a given type is created, the priority list for that event is considered. Two days before the event, a script runs that goes through the priority list for that event and "extends an invite" to each player in order; each player will either accept or reject the invitation (based on some sort of logic that considers the player's form, their ranking, etc., to simulate a player deciding whether he needs to accept the invite). If a player accepts the invite, they are locked into the field for that event, and if they reject, they are not included in the field for that event, and their name is ignored on any subsequent priority list categories that they might be in for that specific event, so they are not "asked again"; the script then goes to the next person in the priority list and the cycle repeats until all positions in the field have been filled.
